# Des Moines Citibikesharing Proposal
Data Visualization using Tableau

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to extrapolate pertinent data from NYC Citibike bikeshare from August 2019 (https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) to determine what metrics need to be consider to bring it to Des Moines.

## Results

1. More bikes are utilized downtown Manhattan, closer to tourist locations

2. Average bike rides last about 5 hours

3. Despite more men using the bikes than women and unknown genders, the pattern remains the same of average rides lasting about 5 hours

4. Monday through Friday, most users use bikes between 7-9am and 5-7pm, reflective of typical work hours; the distribution on Saturday and Sunday is consistent between 10am and 6pm

5. Although less women users than men users, the pattern is the same for start and stoptime distribution. More unknown genders use the services on the weekend, reflective of tourist use

![NYC Story (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88955412/142132532-272b8e00-04fe-4229-8344-a08e59a14eaa.png)
6. Overwhelmingly more men are subscribers than every day users. Unknown genders are slightly more every day users than men or women

![NYC Story (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88955412/142132594-69419cca-6a05-4c90-a1b2-fb5799ba7c0b.png)
7. It's important to be aware bikes will need repair but their is a distribution, reassuring that most bikes won't need repair as often

## Summary
Bike sharing is clearly a popular form of transportation, for every day use as well as to explore a new city. Just like any city, NYC has pockets of larger populations and therefore more demand. Demand, realistic of Des Moines, will have to be determined to provide enough bikes without too much excess. Two additional visualizations that would be of interested would be to see the frequency of starting and ending locations by gender and peak hours by gender, to determine if there are locations more frequented by certain genders.
